# My_schedules
1. This is the 4th Project by INCO Academy. We had to work on this project as a team and we used github to collabrate.
2. This aim of the project is to make a web app where user can login to see all the schedules and create new schedules too.

# Task -
1. All the details of Users and schedules will be stored in a database.
2. Only existing user can login to the application.
3. New users can signup with the signup page.
4. In sign up you have to fill all input field and also password and confirm-password should be same. And password is saved as hash and not as plain text. When user tries to login, password will have to match with the hash password.
5. User can create schedules from schedule form. The users who are signed in can create schedules only for themselves.
6. Overlap of time during creation of schedule is not allowed. 
7. User can not select an end-time which is earlier to the start time.
8. After logout user has to login again.


# Technology we used -
1. Node.js
2. Express
3. Ejs
4. bcrypt -  for converting the password in hash.
5. DATABASE - SQL AND PostgreSQL



# This is how project will work
